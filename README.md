# Findings and Recommendations 
1. Revenue: We could explore ways to further increase overall revenue by introducing more premium bundles or exclusive collections.
2. Delivery Time: Perhaps reducing the average delivery time slightly may improve customer satisfaction and retention.
3. Monthly Sales: Since sales peak around festivals like Raksha Bandhan and Valentine’s, we might consider aligning more campaigns around these months.
4. Top Products: Our premium gift sets are performing well, so it may be helpful to promote them more prominently.
5. Customer Spending: Since average spending is quite healthy, we could gently introduce upselling options like add-ons or personalized products.
6. Top 5 Products: As the top products are close in performance, highlighting them in seasonal promotions might give an extra push.
7. Cities: Since Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities are ordering well, we may think of localized offers or faster delivery options in these regions.
8. Delivery & Order Size: Since bigger orders don’t delay delivery, we could reassure customers about reliability and encourage bulk gifting.
9. Occasions: Some occasions like Diwali are a bit lower in sales; with a little more festive marketing, we might be able to tap into that potential.
10 .Product-Occasion Fit: Since different products shine in different festivals, tailoring product promotions for each occasion may help boost engagement.

# Conclusion
The sales analysis shows strong revenue with peaks during Valentine’s Day, Raksha Bandhan, and Anniversaries. Premium gift sets drive the most sales, Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities contribute heavily, and delivery times remain consistent. Overall, the insights highlight key growth areas in occasions, products, and customer behavior
